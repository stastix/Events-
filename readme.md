# DevOps Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of DevOps practices to optimize the development lifecycle of an application. The primary tools and concepts used include:

- **Jenkins**: A continuous integration server to automate build and testing for every code change.
- **Docker**: Containerization to ensure the portability of the application across different environments.
- **Git**: Version control for tracking changes to the source code.
- **Nexus**: A repository manager to store and distribute application artifacts.
- **SonarQube**: A code quality tool to continuously evaluate and improve the codebase.
- **Grafana and Prometheus**: Real-time monitoring and visualization solutions to track performance metrics.
- **JUnit and Mockito**: Unit testing and mocking frameworks to validate business logic and isolated behaviors, ensuring code reliability.

This project aims to establish a streamlined, automated, and monitored DevOps pipeline to enhance development efficiency and software quality.
